# StocksWatcher

## How to use this

First, create a Finnhub account, and grab an API key (free!)

Once done, create a new `.env` file by copying `.env.example` and enter the your API key and stocks to watch (comma separated) in there.

Lastly, `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn start`.

Enjoy little-to-no productivity.
